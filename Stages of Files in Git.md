# Stages of Files in Git

Git has three main stages for files: **Untracked**, **Staged**, and **Committed**. Understanding these stages is crucial for effective version control.

## Untracked

- New files that git does not yet tracked 

## Staged

- File is ready to commit (after add . command)

## Modified

- Modified files have been changed but are not staged yet.

## Unmodified

- Unmodified files are committed and have not been changed since the last commit.

## Committed

- Committed files are those that have been saved in Git's database.
- When you use `git commit`, you create a new snapshot of your project.

Understanding and managing the stages of files in Git is essential for effective version control and collaboration with others on your projects.
